      # We add -Dheadless=true to our code/properties or reliable setup
      # But since our code currently doesn't have a "headless switch" logic explicitly handled 
      # beyond what ChromeOptions usually do (we might need to ensure headless is passed).
      # Actually, let's keep it simple. Standard Chrome on Linux CI usually needs headless.
      # We will pass a system property and update the test to respect it, or just rely on the fact 
      # that we are running in a container.
      # For now, let's just run 'mvn test' and rely on the fact that we might need to update the code 
      # to support headless if it fails, OR we update the code now to support it.
      # Let's update code to read a system property.
